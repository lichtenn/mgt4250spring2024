Authors: Nina Lichtenberger (nlichtenberger@elon.edu), David Neufang (dneufang@elon.edu)

## Project Description
This repository is for the final class project of MGT 4250: Data Visualization and Storytelling at Elon University. The project aimed at deploying three visualizations via Python to answer a research question. The visualizations were deployed via Streamlit and can be accessed through this [link](https://mgt4250spring2024-finalproject-lichtenberger-neufang.streamlit.app/).
### Question of Interest
The question of interest is which are the main factors determining the medical expenses of an individual in the US. More specifically, the region of residence, sex, smoker status, BMI, age, and number of children will be considered as possible influences.

### Importance
Over the last few decades, medical expenses have witnessed a significant upward trajectory, outpacing inflation rates and posing substantial financial burdens on individuals and healthcare systems globally (Dieleman et al., 2016). Studies have shown that factors such as technological advancements, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, demographic shifts, and healthcare market dynamics contribute to the escalating costs (Lassman et al., 2019). For example, between 1996 and 2019, total national health expenditures grew from $1.4 trillion to $3.8 trillion, representing an average annual growth rate of 4.5% (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2021).
Understanding the multitude of factors that influence medical expenses is paramount for multiple stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, insurers, and individuals themselves. For policymakers, insights garnered from this project can inform evidence-based healthcare policies, aiding in the development of targeted interventions to mitigate rising medical costs and ensure equitable access to healthcare services (Cutler et al., 2018). Healthcare providers stand to benefit from understanding the cost drivers, enabling them to optimize resource allocation and enhance cost-effective care delivery strategies (Papanicolas et al., 2018). Insurers can utilize the findings to refine risk assessment models, design tailored insurance plans, and optimize pricing structures to better serve their clients (Berdahl et al., 2019). Lastly, individuals can make more informed decisions regarding their healthcare utilization and financial planning, thereby empowering them to navigate the complex landscape of healthcare expenditures more effectively (Friedman et al., 2020).
